            Evelyn and Alfred are cousins!!!!!<br/><br/>
            They had already arranged their infamous plot--<br/><br/>
            That he should marry this rich, but rather foolish old lady. <br/><br/>
            Induce her to make a will leaving her money to him, and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived crime. <br/><br/>
            If all had gone as they planned, they would probably have left England, and lived together on their poor victim's money.
